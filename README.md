# Introduction

Around 2013 I finished my psp2 hobby project and published the result on [janfeitsma.nl](http://www.janfeitsma.nl/math/psp2/index).
Since then, Will Galway has been serving the database on his University's [web page](http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/Pseudoprimes/index-2-to-64.html).

This reposity is the new location. The domain janfeitsma.nl will go offline soon due to being relatively costly.
Furthermore, this repo approach allows for better collaboration, should anyone want to contribute changes.

# Data

Data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UXG4EXZ9G9CTrQrk_ymQ_cDEvU-CU_Yp/view?usp=sharing). This is basically the largest of the variants provided by Will. The smaller ones can be trivially derived from this.

File name: `annotated-psps-below-2-to-64.txt.bz2` (about 2GB!).

Md5sum: `52d806c31ca69df2320bda09867161dc`

It lists both the pseudoprimes and their prime factorizations, with additional annotations:

* Column 1: "C" if the pseudoprime is a Carmichael number, blank otherwise.
* Column 2: "S" if the pseudoprime is a strong pseudoprime, blank otherwise.

The first 10 lines read:
```
   341 11 31
C  561 3 11 17
   645 3 5 43
C  1105 5 13 17
