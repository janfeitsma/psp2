# Introduction

Around 2013 I finished my psp2 hobby project and published the result on [janfeitsma.nl](http://www.janfeitsma.nl/math/psp2/index).
Since then, Will Galway has been serving the database on his University's [web page](http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/Pseudoprimes/index-2-to-64.html).

This reposity is the new location.
The domain janfeitsma.nl will go offline soon, because paying ~~60~~ ~~70~~ ~~85~~ euros per year is a bit too steep for hosting just a few 10s of KB of content.
Furthermore, this repo approach allows for better collaboration, should anyone want to contribute changes.
